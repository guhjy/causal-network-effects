======================

Causal inference with interference.
There is inteference among units when the assignment on a node i
affects the observed outcome on a node j. This presents a challenge to causal inference
since comparing experiment active treatment and control units cannot be reliable 
if interference is not taken into account. 

This package is the software implementation of the methods in
Estimation of Causal Peer Influence Effects, Panos Toulis and Edward Kao.
